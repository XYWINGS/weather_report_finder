## üß† How It Works

- Weather API returns a `condition.code`
- Code is matched against **pre-defined groups** (e.g., rainCodes, snowCodes, etc.)
- UI updates:

  - üåà **Gradient** background (`getWeatherGradient`)
  - üéûÔ∏è **Animation** layer (`getWeatherAnimation`)
  - üßä **Iconography** (`getWeatherIcon`)

## üß© Tech Stack

- üåà MUI + Custom SVG Icons
- üîÅ WeatherAPI
