## üß† How It Works

- Weather API returns a weather response for the users default location initially. After that users can get weather reports from typing and searching city names.
- Weather condition code is matched against **pre-defined groups**

  - üåà **Gradient** background (`getWeatherGradient`)
  - üéûÔ∏è **Animation** layer (`getWeatherAnimation`)
  - üßä **Iconography** (`getWeatherIcon`)
